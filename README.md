# 🚀 Journey Optimization

Welcome to the **Journey Optimization** project! This tool helps commuters find the **optimal travel route** between two points using a map interface. The project uses algorithms like **A\*** to calculate the most efficient route, whether you're optimizing for **time**, **distance**, or **cost**.

## 🗺️ What is Journey Optimization?

Journey Optimization is a tool designed to make travel easier by calculating the **fastest**, **shortest**, or **cheapest** routes. It allows users to:
- Select start and end points on an interactive map.
- Calculate the best route based on selected preferences.
